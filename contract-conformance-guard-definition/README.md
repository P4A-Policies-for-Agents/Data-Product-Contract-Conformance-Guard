# "contract-conformance-guard" Policy

This policy was created with the Flex Gateway Policy Development Kit (PDK). To find the complete PDK documentation, see [PDK Overview](https://docs.mulesoft.com/pdk/latest/policies-pdk-overview) on the Mulesoft documentation site.

The policy is the policy-definition part of a policy.

## Make command reference
This project has a Makefile that includes different goals that assist the developer during the policy development lifecycle.

*For more information about the Makefile, see [Makefile](https://docs.mulesoft.com/pdk/latest/policies-pdk-create-project#makefile).*

### Build
The `make build` goal compiles the definition of the policy.

*For more information about `make build`, see [Compiling Custom Policies](https://docs.mulesoft.com/pdk/latest/policies-pdk-compile-policies).*

### Publish
The `make publish` goal publishes the policy definition asset in Anypoint Exchange, in your configured Organization.

Since the publish goal is intended to publish a policy asset in development, the _assetId_ and name published will explicitly say `dev`, and the versions published will include a timestamp at the end of the version. Eg.
- groupId: your configured organization id
- visible name: _{Your policy name} Dev_
- assetId: _{your-policy-asset-id}-dev_
- version: _{your-policy-version}-20230618115723_

*For more information about publishing policies, see [Uploading Custom Policies to Exchange](https://docs.mulesoft.com/pdk/latest/policies-pdk-publish-policies).*


### Release
The `make release` goal also publishes the policy definition to Anypoint Exchange, but as a ready for production asset. In this case, the groupId, visible name, assetId and version will be the ones defined in the project.

*For more information about releasing policies, see [Uploading Custom Policies to Exchange](https://docs.mulesoft.com/pdk/latest/policies-pdk-publish-policies).*

### Release Local
The `make release-local` goal publishes the policy definition as a release asset to the local Anypoint Exchange cache, you'll be able to override it. This target is useful if you are also developing the policy implementation. 

*For more information about releasing policies, see [Uploading Custom Policies to Exchange](https://docs.mulesoft.com/pdk/latest/policies-pdk-publish-policies).*


### Policy Examples

The PDK provides provides a set of example policy projects to get started creating policies and using the PDK features. To learn more about these examples see [Custom policy Examples](https://docs.mulesoft.com/pdk/latest/policies-pdk-policy-templates).
